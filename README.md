## Rules

1. [UnderPopulation]
    Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies,  as if caused by under-population.
2. [Lives]
    Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. [Overcrowding]
    Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies,  as if by overcrowding.
4. [Birth]
    Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell,  as if by reproduction.
